### **Overview**: 
The proposed timeline project that is to be developed for the Niagara On The Lake Museum will be developed using a Scrum methodology consisting of a small team of five members to ensure quality development.

The features also make ths project a significant educational tool in making to spread more than just surface knowledge about history.
